Well, this is my first post..

<br>Just wanted to test my NodeJS + poet combo. I realize that loading
up a wordpress website was just way too boring, so why not use an npm
module that loads markdown based files to generate a blog?

I assume the process would be long and tedious to be quiet frank, but overall it was
far less effort. Since I am a minimalist, and
this takes minimal setup, effort and tools in the long run, it was the obvious option.
